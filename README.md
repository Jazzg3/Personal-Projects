While working for IEM, the largest independent switchgear manufacturer at the time, I was as a full-time field technician on Amazon data center sites for six weeks as part of the commissioning team tasked with final installation, safety and electrical checks, and general fixes. Before this, I completed six weeks of training on low and medium voltage switchgear design, assembly, and testing at the IEM Florida switchgear factory. I also received training in the basics of engineering management. Additionally, I participated in final maintinence and administrative handover of the responsibility for switchgear to Amazon Web Services.

In a consulting role for Calaveras Hydropower, I conducted a survey of a potential new aquisition, a 750kw hydropower plant fed by a small dam in the foothills. This 750kw hydropower plant is set up to sell power to PG&E directly, which is the company that provides electricity to millions of people living in Northern California. My tasks included conducting technical assesments, troubleshooting, performing data analysis, and executing manual opperation tests.
