I am currently responsible for managing a dozen engineers and all electrical related tasks and deadlines for Yonder Deep. This means I'm the top technician in the design, prototyping, and manufacturing process of our unmanned autonomus submersible meant to conduct climate change research projects in adverse temperature conditions. I'm responsible for effective coordination with Mechanical and Software engineering teams as well as for field repairs and maintenance of all electrical equipment.

## Amazon site work

I worked as a full time field technician on Amazon data center sites for six weeks as part of the commissioning team tasked with final installation, safety and electrical checks, as well as general fixes. Before this, I completed six weeks of training on low and medium voltage switchgear design, assembly, and testing. I also recieved training in the basics of engineering management in addition to the six weeks working in the field. Additionally I participated in final handover of the responsibility for switchgear to Amazon Web Services.
